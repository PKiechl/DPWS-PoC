# just UDP flooding and ICMP flooding in terms of vector config, nothing fancy with attackers having different DRs or packet sizes

# Topology such that no attackers or targets are within the same AS. That would be still a valid config, but then you don't
# get to capture the traffic, between attackers/targets in the same AS, as it never passes through any IXP node interface.

# Topology also puts all targets into the same AS (AS 2), such that the entire attack traffic is visible at one interface,
# for easy showcasing
