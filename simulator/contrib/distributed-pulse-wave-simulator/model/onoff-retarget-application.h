/* Note by Pascal Kiechl<pascal.kiechl@uzh.ch>:
 * This file is an adaptation of the OnOff-Application by the above author (George F. Riley) that is
 * part of ns-3. It includes modifications that allow for a number of additional functionalities:
 *      - Setting a new remote to be able to dynamically switch the target to which traffic is sent
 *          This includes closing and opening a new socket, such that it works with protocols with
 *          handshake/teardown procedures such as TCP.
 *          This cycling of sockets also relies on a patch that (presumably) will be part of ns-3
 *          as of Version 3.39. See PATCHES.md for context.
 *      - A number of attack vector specific interactions regarding the use of specific protocols
 *          with the RawSocketImplementation, as well as taking into account attack vector (or
 *          protocol) properties when computing data rate, packet size and packet creation.
 *          Credit for the TCP SYN and ICMP attack vector implementations go to Calvin Falter, as
 *          they have been taken from his EDDD project with only very minor changes
 *      - Ability to set flags to force immediate send upon start and/or changing the remote to cut
 *          through any potential delays that stem from the cycling of on/off states
 *      - Ability to configure data rate fluctuations based on a simple normal distribution

/**
 * \ingroup onoff
 *
 * \brief Generate traffic to a single destination according to an
 *        OnOff pattern.
 *
 * This traffic generator follows an On/Off pattern: after
 * Application::StartApplication
 * is called, "On" and "Off" states alternate. The duration of each of
 * these states is determined with the onTime and the offTime random
 * variables. During the "Off" state, no traffic is generated.
 * During the "On" state, cbr traffic is generated. This cbr traffic is
 * characterized by the specified "data rate" and "packet size".
 *
 * Note:  When an application is started, the first packet transmission
 * occurs _after_ a delay equal to (packet size/bit rate).  Note also,
 * when an application transitions into an off state in between packet
 * transmissions, the remaining time until when the next transmission
 * would have occurred is cached and is used when the application starts
 * up again.  Example:  packet size = 1000 bits, bit rate = 500 bits/sec.
 * If the application is started at time 3 seconds, the first packet
 * transmission will be scheduled for time 5 seconds (3 + 1000/500)
 * and subsequent transmissions at 2 second intervals.  If the above
 * application were instead stopped at time 4 seconds, and restarted at
 * time 5.5 seconds, then the first packet would be sent at time 6.5 seconds,
 * because when it was stopped at 4 seconds, there was only 1 second remaining
 * until the originally scheduled transmission, and this time remaining
 * information is cached and used to schedule the next transmission
 * upon restarting.
 *
 * If the underlying socket type supports broadcast, this application
 * will automatically enable the SetAllowBroadcast(true) socket option.
 *
 * If the attribute "EnableSeqTsSizeHeader" is enabled, the application will
 * use some bytes of the payload to store an header with a sequence number,
 * a timestamp, and the size of the packet sent. Support for extracting
 * statistics from this header have been added to \c ns3::PacketSink
 * (enable its "EnableSeqTsSizeHeader" attribute), or users may extract
 * the header via trace sources.  Note that the continuity of the sequence
 * number may be disrupted across On/Off cycles.
